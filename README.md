# MovieCentral

Started coding: dec, 2018.

Bootcamp week 5 february 2019.

This week we were assigned to make a website with the use of a database, login / register form, (user/admin) and a cart.

The idea was a website where you can buy movies. 

If you login as admin, you are able to add new movies to the movie page (and database). 

This was the first time I used php sessions, a user and admin login and gifs.  

It was a good practice to make this. 

The most hard part was the shopping cart. I made it work really basic, so when you are signed in, you are able to add a product to the cart, which will put it in the database with the signed in user id. You can browse to the cart and see the added product. I made a button on the cart items where you are able to delete the item from the cart, and database.
